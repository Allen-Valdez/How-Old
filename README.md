# How-Old
Using JavaScript only, this function takes in your age and whatever year and dishes out three different cases. If the year is in the future, it will return what your age will be in that year, if the year provided is in the past it will tell you how old you were then, and lastly if the year is before you were born it will tell you how many years prior to your birth year.
